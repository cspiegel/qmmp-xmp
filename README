This is a plugin for Qmmp (1.3.1 or greater) which supports module
(tracker) files using libxmp (http://xmp.sf.net/).

The following packages are required, including development headers,
which some vendors split into separate packages:

• qmmp
• libxmp
• qt5

To build, run Qt5's qmake (often installed as qmake-qt5) and then build
with make:

$ qmake-qt5
$ make

To install:

$ make install

This installs the plugin into Qmmp's input plugin directory.  To install
to a staging area, such as for packaging:

$ make install INSTALL_ROOT=/path/to/staging

Note: As of 0.9.0, qmmp-plugin-pack includes a plugin based on libxmp,
rendering this plugin redundant.  However, I'd already written this and
was planning on releasing it, so here it is.
